# Restaurant Page - The Odin Project

This was a really cool project to work on as I had to mainly work in Javascript. I styled everything beforehand CSS and hardcoding all the HTML elements. Then I removed all of them and made them appear using only Javascript (outside of the CSS styling which I left). 

I plan on revisiting this project at some point in the future. Todos:

* Remove as much CSS as possible and define it in javascript.
* Remove as much HTML as possible and define it in javascript.
* Add some more content to the site
